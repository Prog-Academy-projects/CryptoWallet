**JavaScript web application simulating an online Cryptocurrency Wallet**  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Prog-Academy-projects/CryptoWallet)


## ✨ Project Overview
CryptoWallet demonstrates practical front-end development skills including dynamic UI, API interaction, client-side data storage, and responsive design.  

Users can view balances, perform simulated transactions, see real-time cryptocurrency data, track currency rates, and manage their profile. 

## 🚀 Functional Features
- Online fetching of cryptocurrency rates and historical data (via external APIs)  
- Local data storage using **localStorage** and **IndexedDB**  
- **Real-time dashboard** rendering with dynamic charts and balances  
- Wallet simulation: storing coins and updating balances  
- **Currency conversion & swap** operations based on exchange rates  
- Basic authentication and simple **user login system**  
- Personal user profile page  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML** - adaptive interface for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **CSS** – custom styling and responsive layouts  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – core application logic  
- **Fetch API** – integration with external crypto APIs (e.g., CoinGecko)
- **Bootstrap 5.3.3** – grid system and UI components for responsive design
- **Template-based layout (layout.html)** – reusable page structure 
- **localStorage & IndexedDB** – client-side data persistence
- **Simple Auth** – basic authorization & profile management

## 📌 Important Notes

- This is a student project created as part of a FrontEnt Pro course.
- Designed for demonstration purposes for potential employers, recruiters, and teachers.
- Focused on implementing adaptive & responsive UI/UX and basic external API integrations.
- Sensitive credentials should always be protected using environment variables or secret managers.
- To use the external API, you need to get an API Key: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api.

## Possible Improvements
- Full authentication system with JWT or OAuth2
- Integrate with real cryptocurrency wallets (Web3, Metamask)
- Add backend API for persistent data storage
- Advanced UI/UX for mobile-first design  
- Push notifications for price changes
